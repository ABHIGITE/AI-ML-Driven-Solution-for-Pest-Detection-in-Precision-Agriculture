# AI-ML-Driven-Solution-for-Pest-Detection-in-Precision-Agriculture

This project uses AI and machine learning algorithms to detect pests in crop images. It helps farmers find pest problems early to protect crops and improve yield. We collected and labeled pest images, trained a model using CNN (EfficientNetB0), and used XGBoost for better accuracy.


ðŸ”§ Features:
- Detects pests from crop images

- Uses deep learning (CNN) and machine learning (XGBoost)

- Helps in early pest detection

- Improves crop health and productivity
