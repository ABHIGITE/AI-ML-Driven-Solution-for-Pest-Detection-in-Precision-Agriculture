# AI-ML-Driven-Solution-for-Pest-Detection-in-Precision-Agriculture

This project uses AI and machine learning algorithms to detect pests in crop images. It helps farmers identify pest problems early to protect crops and increase yield. The model was trained using CNN (EfficientNetB0) and XGBoost for better accuracy. A simple GUI was built using Tkinter, and the project was developed and run using Spyder (Anaconda).


ðŸ”§ Features:
- Detects pests from crop images

- User-friendly GUI using Tkinter

- Combines deep learning (CNN) and machine learning (XGBoost)

- Developed and tested using Spyder IDE

- Helps in early pest detection and crop protection
